## âœ¨ Getting Started

- Make sure you already have `Node.js` and `npm` installed in your system.
- You need an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). After creating an account, [grab your key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys).
- Then, under the `src` directory, go to `api/OpenWeatherService`.
- To protect your api key, install dotenv 
``` 
npm install dotenv
```
- create a .env file in your root directory, and add 
```
REACT_APP_API_KEY = replace-this-with-your-api-key
```
  - **`api/OpenWeatherService.js`**: It contains the code related to the back-end of the application.
